## Watch CS50 Course
CS50 is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University.<br>
You can skip the first part about scratch and dive into C language. It is one of the best courses to teach you about data structures and how our machines think.<br>
which is a must-know in order to better manipulate data structures.
Make sure to study data structures, python, JS and HTML through it because we'll need them later.<br>
The course also provide a free online compiler to train on while going through the course!<br>
