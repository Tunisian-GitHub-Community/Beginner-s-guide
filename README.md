## Watch CS50 Course
CS50 is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University.<br>
You can skip the first part about scratch and dive into C language. It is one of the best courses to teach you about data structures and how our machines think.<br>
which is a must-know in order to better manipulate data structures.
Make sure to study data structures, python, JS and HTML through it because we'll need them later.<br>
The course also provide a free online compiler to train on while going through the course!<br>

## Learn Object Oriented Programming
Learn the difference between Functional programms and Object Oriented Programs.
Functional programming is the programming technique that accentuates the functional factors required for creating and implementing the programs. OOP or the Object-Oriented Programs are the conceptual programming techniques that uses objects as the key.
I'd recommend to study OOP with Java. OOPs is considered to be the basic for almost every OP language. When you're familiar with it, you'll be able to understand most of the major concepts that any language incorporate ( like abstraction, multi-threading,..etc) 

## Learn The Art Of Googling
Google Search is a powerful tool, yet you're not using its full potential.
Know where to search for information, and how to search for it. understand the notion of forums,discussions and subreddits.<br>
Searching the web is an art, I hope this article helps you to discover some of the tips and tricks that might make your life much easier.<br>
Get familiar with StackOverflow, Medium, framework forums, github forums, documentation..etc
Also Master the indian accent.

## Start Competitive Programming
Competitive programming teaches you how to be a better problem solver, you'll learn about complexity, data structures and algorithms.
It'll teach you to write better code, and become better at debugging.
There's a Tunisian Youtube Channel called Coding BeTounsi by Raouf. He'll take you through your CP journey.
Big Thanks for his Great work !!

## Learn HTML/CSS
This will come in handy in future projects. you'll have to learn HTML sooner or later.
You don't need to memorize the commands by heart, just understand the basics and put in mind the keywords to google when you need a specific command.
Also I'd advise you to learn by testing. Platforms such as GeeksforGeeks and W3Schools offer this feature using their online compilers for free.

## Create your first website from scratch
It's time to create projects! Try to put your knowledge into practise through coding a simple website ( blog page, protfolio website ..Etc)

## Learn How to Automate Tasks with Python and/or javascript
There's a great book called Automate The Boring Stuff with Python That I'd really recommend.
You could create a web scraper and scrape data. May I recommend Scrapy, or BeatifulSoup & Selenium.

#### pro tip:
You could get any book & research article, pdf version using:
-[Sci-Hub](sci-hub.se)<br>
-[pdfDrive](https://www.pdfdrive.com/)<br>

## Linux
Learn the notion of packages and open source.
Also installing programming softwares on linux is much easier than windows, and no matter how shitty your hardware is, Linux will run smoothly.

## Learn How to Use Github
Learn the concept of version control.
Create Repositories, put your simple website and scraping tool that you created.

## Next Step
You simply need to start. instead of watching courses in order to get the certifications, Learn by actually doing. Project based Learning is the best way to get the hold of a concept.
when you start a project you'll find out that you didn't get the hang of a concept that you thought you have. so test yourself practice more !
